    <string name="tourintro"> Hello, and welcome to THE best guided tour of the University of Virginia!
         We call it the best because it is more than just the follow-the-tourguide kind of thing, 
         rather, it is interactive! Here is how it works, we are not going to tell you where 
         the destinations we have planned for you are. You have to find them yourself! 
         We will give you clues, however. Use this app to see if you are getting closer
          (if the screen turns more red), or if you are getting farther (the screen would
           turn more blue) </string>
